			**Smart Parking System – IoT Application**

&nbsp;					Overview



The Smart Parking System is an automated parking management solution designed to address the challenges of increased vehicle density, inefficient parking operations, and the lack of real-time slot monitoring in urban environments.

This system uses Arduino, IR sensors, servo motors, and an LCD display to detect slot availability, control entry/exit gates, and provide real-time parking information.



The project was designed and simulated using Tinkercad, demonstrating how automation can optimize parking space usage and minimize human involvement.

**Features**

Automatic vehicle detection using IR sensors

Real-time slot availability display on LCD

Automated entry and exit gate control using servo motors

Reduced congestion and improved space utilization

Continuous monitoring and updates

Prototype simulation in Tinkercad.



**Problem Statement**

Urban areas face challenges such as:

Drivers wasting time searching for parking

Increased traffic congestion and fuel consumption

Manual parking management errors

No real-time updates about slot availability

Poor parking space utilization

The Smart Parking System solves these issues through automation and sensor-based real-time monitoring.



**Components**

Arduino UNO

IR Sensors (vehicle detection)

Servo Motors (gate control)

LCD Display 16x2

Breadboard, jumper wires, resistors

Power supply module

Optional: Buzzer for alerts



**Working Flow**

Sensors detect whether slots are occupied or vacant.

Arduino processes sensor inputs and updates the LCD display.

Entry gate opens when a vehicle is detected at the entrance.

Slot availability updates instantly when a car enters or leaves.

Exit gate opens automatically for vehicles leaving.

The system repeats continuously, providing real-time monitoring.
